## Project Description

The Oracle ARCS project involved the implementation and optimization of the reconciliation processes in an organization, particularly focusing on:

- **Transaction Matching**: Automated matching of transactions based on predefined criteria to minimize manual effort and errors.
- **Reconciliation**: Streamlined processes to ensure that financial data is accurate and compliant with accounting standards.
- **Report Development**: Creation of customized reports to provide insights into reconciliation performance, discrepancies, and compliance metrics.
- **Profile Management**: Ability to create and manage profiles for various reconciliation needs, allowing flexibility in handling different types of transactions.
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Oracle systems to leverage existing data for reconciliation.

## Features

- **Automated Transaction Matching**: Configuration of rules to automate the reconciliation process based on transaction attributes.
- **Custom Profile Creation**: Create and manage profiles tailored to specific reconciliation requirements.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed reports for performance tracking and discrepancy resolution.
- **User Security Configuration**: Configure user roles and permissions to ensure data security and compliance.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and Profile Creation

- Conducted profile creation based on client requirements.
- Extracted data from Oracle systems for reconciliation processes.
- Developed a framework for matching transactions using standard rules.

### Phase 2: Enhanced Profiles and Workflow Integration

- Added additional profiles to cater to diverse reconciliation needs.
- Integrated profiles into workflows with designated reviewers for oversight.
- Managed period openings and closings during the hypercare phase.
- Created accounts at the console level to streamline processes further.

1. **Data Extraction**: Extract data from Oracle systems using configured profiles.
2. **Matching Process**: Apply automated matching rules to identify corresponding transactions.
3. **Review**: Transactions that cannot be matched automatically are flagged for manual review by users.

### Reporting Example

A custom reconciliation report can be generated as follows:

```sql
SELECT 
    TransactionID,
    Amount,
    Status,
    MatchedTransactionID
FROM 
    ReconciliationReport
WHERE 
    Status = 'Pending'
ORDER BY 
    TransactionID;
